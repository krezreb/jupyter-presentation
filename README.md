# This is an intro to jupyter for DevOps

The goal is to present jupyter as a tool for fun, education and work and showcase some of its unique features.

Working knowledge of bash, linux, recommended.  Some python is also recommended but not necessary.

## requirements

Linux (ubuntu/debian)

```
apt install python3 python3-pip python3-venv
```

Once the above dependencies are installed, just run `bash start.sh` which will create a virtual env, install python dependencies, start the notebook server and open it in your web browser.  From there, open Intro.ipynb.
